* figure out a better name (than outboxinterface), and decide where to merge
  (in mailtransport?)
* better name for MessageQueuer?
* Figure out a better way to configure the resource via D-Bus.
* Krazy wants me to use private d-pointers in the attributes -- probably a good
  idea since this is a library?...
* if stuff like dispatchManually (stuff that modifies the outbox in general)
  stays in DispatcherInterface, then it should really be called OutboxInterface
  (too bad that's a conflict).
* provide a dispatcherReady() signal in DispatcherInterface, and think of what
  should happen if it is not ready...
* provide a job to modify items in the outbox such as
  - remove error attribute and re-queue
  - change Never dispatch mode to Immediately
