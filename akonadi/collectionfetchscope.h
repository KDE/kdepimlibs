/**
 * @short Specifies which parts of a collection should be fetched from the Akonadi storage.
 *
 * When collections are fetched from the server either by using CollectionFetchJob
 * explicitly or when it is being used internally by other classes, e.g. Akonadi::Monitor,
 * the scope of the fetch operation can be tailored to the application's current needs.
 *
 * Note that CollectionFetchScope always includes fetching collection attributes.
 *
 * There are two supported ways of changing the currently active CollectionFetchScope
 * of classes:
 * - in-place: modify the CollectionFetchScope object the other class holds as a member
 * - replace: replace the other class' member with a new scope object
 *
 * Example: modifying a CollectionFetchJob's scope @c in-place
 * @code
 * Akonadi::CollectionFetchJob *job = new Akonadi::CollectionFetchJob( collection );
 * job->fetchScope().setIncludeUnsubscribed( true );
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example: @c replacing a CollectionFetchJob's scope
 * @code
 * Akonadi::CollectionFetchScope scope;
 * scope.setIncludeUnsubscribed( true );
 *
 * Akonadi::CollectionFetchJob *job = new Akonadi::CollectionFetchJob( collection );
 * job->setFetchScope( scope );
 * @endcode
 *
 * This class is implicitly shared.
