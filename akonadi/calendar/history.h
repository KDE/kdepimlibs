/**
   @short History class for implementing undo/redo of calendar operations

   Whenever you use IncidenceChanger to create, delete or modify incidences,
   this class is used to record those changes onto a stack, so they can be
   undone or redone.

   If needed, groupware invitations will be sent to attendees and organizers when
   undoing or redoing changes.

   This class can't be instantiated directly, use it through IncidenceChanger:

   @code
      Akonadi::IncidenceChanger *myIncidenceChanger = new Akonadi::IncidenceChanger();
      connect( undoAction, SIGNAL(triggered()), myIncidenceChanger->history(), SLOT(undo()) );
      connect( redoAction, SIGNAL(triggered()), myIncidenceChanger->history(), SLOT(redo()) );
   @endcode
