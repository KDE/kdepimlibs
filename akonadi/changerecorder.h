 * an agent is not online and replaying the notifications when the agent
 * is online again. Therefore the agent doesn't have to care about
 * online/offline mode in its synchronization algorithm.
 *
 * Unlike Akonadi::Monitor this class only emits one change signal at a
 * time. To receive the next one you need to explicitly call replayNext().
 * If a signal is emitted that has no receivers, it's automatically skipped,
 * which means you only need to connect to signals you are actually interested
 * in.
