  * @short Resource implementing mail transport capability.

  * ResourceBase and TransportResourceBase, implements the virtual method
  * sendItem(), and calls itemSent() when finished sending.
  *
  * The resource must also have the "MailTransport" capability flag. For example
  * the desktop file may contain:
    \code
    X-Akonadi-Capabilities=Resource,MailTransport
    \endcode
  *
  * For an example of a transport-enabled resource, see
  * kdepim/runtime/resources/mailtransport_dummy
