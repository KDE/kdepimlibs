/**
 * @short A helper class that saves and restores state of an EntityTreeView
 *
 * This class saves and restores the state of a QTreeView showing an EntityTreeModel,
 * or whatever proxies are stacked on top of one. State so far means the current selection
 * and expansion of the items and collections.
 *
 * The EntityTreeViewStateSaver is needed because populating the EntityTreeModel
 * is asynchronous and finding the right point in time to restore the state is a
 * difficult task that is hidden inside this class.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * class MyWidget : public QWidget
 * {
 *   public:
 *      MyWidget( QWidget* parent );
 *      ~MyWidget();
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *   private:
 *     KConfig *mGlobalConfig;
 *     QTreeView *mTreeView;
 *     Akonadi::EntityTreeViewStateSaver *mStateSaver;
 * };
 *
 * MyWidget::MyWidget( QWidget *parent )
 *   : QWidget( parent )
 * {
 *   mGlobalConfig = ...
 *   mTreeView = new QTreeView( this );
 *   ...
 *
 *   mStateSaver = new Akonadi::EntityTreeViewStateSaver( mTreeView );
 *
 *   KConfigGroup group( mGlobalConfig, "treeViewState" );
 *   mStateSaver->restoreState( group );
 * }
 *
 * MyWidget::~MyWidget()
 * {
 *   KConfigGroup group( mGlobalConfig, "treeViewState" );
 *   mStateSaver->saveState( group );
 * }
 *
 * @endcode

 * @deprecated This class is deprecated. Use ETMViewStateSaver instead.
