 * @short Filter model which hides/shows entites marked as trash

 * Filter model which either hides all entities marked as trash, or the ones not marked.
 * Subentities of collections marked as trash are also shown in the trash.

 * The Base model must be an EntityTreeModel and the EntityDeletedAttribute must be available.

 *
 * @code
 *
 * ChangeRecorder *monitor = new Akonadi::ChangeRecorder( this );
 * monitor->itemFetchScope().fetchAttribute<Akonadi::EntityDisplayAttribute>(true);

 * Akonadi::EntityTreeModel *sourcemodel = new Akonadi::EntityTreeModel(monitor, this);

 * model->setDynamicSortFilter(true);
 * model->setSourceModel(sourcemodel);
