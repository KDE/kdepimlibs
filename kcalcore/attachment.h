  @brief
  Represents information related to an attachment for a Calendar Incidence.

  This is not an email message attachment.

  Calendar Incidence attachments consist of:
  - A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">
    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</a>
    or a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#MIME">base64 encoded</a>
    binary blob.
  - A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME">
    Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)</a> type.

  This class is used to associate files (local or remote) or other resources
  with a Calendar Incidence.
