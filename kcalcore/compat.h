  only counted if it matched, so by accident this was already the correct

  @brief
  Compatibility class for KOrganizer pre-3.1 calendar files.

  Before kde 3.1, floating events (events without a date) had 0:00 of their
  last day as the end date. E.g. 28.5.2005  0:00 until 28.5.2005 0:00 for an
  event that lasted the whole day on May 28, 2005. According to RFC 2445, the
  end date for such an event needs to be 29.5.2005 0:00.

  Update: We misunderstood rfc 2445 in this regard. For all-day events, the
  DTEND is the last day of the event. See a mail from the Author or rfc 2445:
    http://www.imc.org/ietf-calendar/archive1/msg03648.html
  However, as all other applications also got this wrong, we'll just leave it
  as it is and use the wrong interpretation (was also discussed on ietf-calsify)
