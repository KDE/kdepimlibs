kdepimlibs POLICIES.

A. Purpose

   The kdepimlibs module exists to:

   1. restrain the size of the kdepim module
   2. co-locate code in kdelibs which is closely associated to kdepim
      (i.e.,kresources and kabc).  That this code is in kdelibs, but
      other similar code like libkcal is not, can only be understood by
      historical  reasons.
   3. provide access to the PIM libraries for code from other modules.

   In summary, kdepimlibs is a controlled extension and modularization of
   kdelibs to the PIM space.  The kdepimlibs module will adhere to the
   KDE release schedules.


B. Contents

   The kdepimlibs will contain libraries only.  No applications will
   be permitted, except for tools that are needed to build the libraries.
   Typical PIM application source code must reside in the kdepim module.
   Only libraries that would likely to be helpful to other KDE, or 3rd-party
   applications should be included here, i.e., libraries that have no use
   outside of KDE-PIM should be contained in the kdepim module.

   As a general rule-of-thumb, at least 2 separate modules must depend
   on a library before it can be included in kdepimlibs.  Effectively
   this means: a PIM library can be included here if any non-kdepim module
   has a dependency on that library.


C. Licensing

   All source files must follow the licensing policy described in
   http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Licensing_Policy.
   That is, all source files must licensed according to one of the following:

   1. LGPL as listed in COPYING.LIB
   2. BSD license as listed in COPYING.BSD and below
      Note that the BSD license does not contain the so called 'advertisement
      clause'.
   3. X11 license as listed below


D. Dependencies

   kdepimlibs code will require a dependency on kdelibs, but no other
   dependencies on KDE code are permitted.  kdepimlibs may depend on
   3rd-party libraries and, of course, system libraries.  Dependencies
   on all non-kdelibs code must be checked and handled by the buildsystem
   appropriately.

   We will attempt to be backwards compatible to the latest released
   version of kdelibs (within the same major release only).  There is
   no requirement for kdepimlibs to be backwards compatible to lesser
   major releases, i.e. kdepimlibs 5.0 may not be compatible with kdelibs 4.0.


E. Library Code

   We will follow the recommendations in the "KDE Library Code Policy" at 
   http://developer.kde.org/policies/librarypolicy.html, especially
   with regard to binary compatibility.


F. Coding Style

   Please see http://community.kde.org/KDE_PIM/Development/CodingStyle

   Don't use dynamic_cast.  In most cases, the use of dynamic_cast
   is an indication of design problems. In addition, it isn't always
   available, e.g. when compiling without run-time type information
   for KOrganizer/Embedded.
