<para>The nntp kioslave accesses <acronym>NNTP</acronym> servers
directly.</para>

<para>This kioslave can not be used with servers that do not implement
the <command>GROUP</command> command, including some versions of the
popular <application>INN</application> news server which is often used
by <acronym>ISP</acronym>s.  It does work with
<application>leafnode</application>, which many people use to keep an
offline cache of news articles on their own hard drive or within their
<acronym>LAN</acronym>.</para>

<para>You can use the nntp kioslave by typing
<userinput>nntp://yourserver/groupname</userinput> into the &konqueror;
<acronym>URL</acronym> bar.</para>

<para>If you enter a group name, as above, and the group is available,
you will see the messages stored for that group as icons in
&konqueror;.</para>

<para>Clicking on a message will display it as plain text, including all
headers.  This could be useful for debugging a news client to news
server connection, for example, to ensure that your new
<application>leafnode</application> server is working correctly.</para>

<para>If you don't enter a group name, and only the server name, you
will see a list of available groups. </para>

<para>Please be aware that this could take an enormous amount of time, and
will cause a lot of network traffic.  Some commercial usenet servers
have 60,000 or more groups available, and doing such a thing may
cause your desktop to freeze.</para>
