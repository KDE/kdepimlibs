  @glossary @anchor incidence @b incidence:
  General term for a calendar component.
  Examples are events, to-dos, and journals.

  @glossary @anchor event @b event:
  An @ref incidence that has a start and end time, typically representing some
  occurrence of social or personal importance. May be recurring.
  Examples are appointments, meetings, or holidays.

  @glossary @anchor to-do @b to-do:
  An @ref incidence that has an optional start time and an optional due time
  typically representing some undertaking to be performed. May be recurring.
  Examples are "fix the bug" or "pay the bills".

  @glossary @anchor todo @b todo:
  See @ref to-do.

  @glossary @anchor journal @b journal:
  An @ref incidence with a start date that represents a diary or daily record
  of one's activities. May @b not be recurring.

  @brief
  An abstract class that provides a common base for all calendar incidence
  classes.

  define: organizer (person)
  define: uid (same as the attendee uid?)

  Several properties are not allowed for VFREEBUSY objects (see rfc:2445),
  so they are not in IncidenceBase. The hierarchy is:

  IncidenceBase
  + FreeBusy
  + Incidence
    + Event
    + Todo
    + Journal

  So IncidenceBase contains all properties that are common to all classes,
  and Incidence contains all additional properties that are common to
  Events, Todos and Journals, but are not allowed for FreeBusy entries.
