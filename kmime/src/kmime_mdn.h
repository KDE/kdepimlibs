  The following disposition-types are defined:

  @li Displayed    The message has been displayed by the UA to someone
  reading the recipient's mailbox.  There is no guarantee that the
  content has been read or understood.

  @li Dispatched   The message has been sent somewhere in some manner
  (e.g., printed, faxed, forwarded) without necessarily having been previously
  displayed to the user.  The user may or may not see the message later.

  @li Processed    The message has been processed in some manner (i.e., by
  some sort of rules or server) without being displayed to the user.  The user
  may or may not see the message later, or there may not even be a human user
  associated with the mailbox.

  @li Deleted      The message has been deleted.  The recipient may or may not
  have seen the message.  The recipient might "undelete" the message at a
  later time and read the message.

  @li Denied       The recipient does not wish the sender to be informed of the
  message's disposition.  A UA may also siliently ignore message disposition
  requests in this situation.

  @li Failed       A failure occurred that prevented the proper generation
  of an MDN.  More information about the cause of the failure may be contained
  in a Failure field.  The "failed" disposition type is not to be used for
  the situation in which there is is some problem in processing the message
  other than interpreting the request for an MDN.  The "processed" or other
  disposition type with appropriate disposition modifiers is to be used in
  such situations.

  IOW:
  @p Displayed when - well -displayed
  @p Dispatched when forwarding unseen ( == new )
  @p Processed (maybe) when piping unseen, but probably never used
  @p Deleted when deleting unseen
  @p Denied on user command
  @p Failed on Disposition-Notification-Options containing
  unknown required options. ( == @em any required options )
  @p Failed needs a description in the @p special parameter.

  sort of exceptional condition occurred.  Further information is contained
  in a Warning field.

  @li Superseded          The message has been automatically rendered obsolete
  by another message received.  The recipient may still access and read the
  message later.

  @li Expired             The message has reached its expiration date and has
  been automatically removed from the recipient's mailbox.

  @li MailboxTerminated   The recipient's mailbox has been terminated and all
  message in it automatically removed.
