Libraries we want to move into the kdepimlibs module, and what needs to be done
to make it happen.

Minimum requirements for moving a library here:
 1. LGPL, BSD, or X11 license
 2. All dependencies must also meet minimum requirements

BIC stuff (like d-pointers) and complete APIDOX may be completed after the move.

Please drop the "lib" prefix part of the source directory name
(i.e. libfoo -> foo): headers will be installed into include/foo,
but the library name will still be libfoo.so.

Each library foo will have its own foo.h that includes all the
visibility macros  (no separate foo_export_win.h)

To-Be-Determined
================
libkholidays - must stay in kdepim due to licensing. ask the 'plan' author.

High Priority for KDE 4.0
=========================
kpimutils - done, but we want to move email.h into kmime, as some if its
            functions are already in kmime. vkrause.
networkstatus - will be moved by Bille into kdelibs and kdebase

High Priority, but not ready until KDE 4.1
==========================================
libkhalkhi - new, Friedrich W. H. Kossebau <kossebau kde org>
libakonadi - being developed in kdepim, may not be ready until 4.1,
             API currently too unstable for anything with a freeze policy :)

Low Priority (KDE 4.1)
======================
libkdepim - needs a class-by-class review
libksieve - ??
kode - not ready for kdelibs.  kxforms should be in kdepim?  kwsdl??

Really Low Priority (or eliminate entirely)
===========================================
mimelib

Done
====
gpgmepp
kblog
kcal
kimap
kmime
kpimidentities 
ktnef
mailtransport
qgpgme
syndication

Candidates for kdepimlibs-gpl
=============================
kdgantt - May NOT be relicensed. MUST remain GPL (and therefore cannot be moved)
libkleo - May NOT be relicensed. MUST remain GPL (and therefore cannot be moved)
          (requires libkpgp, gpgmepp, qgpgme)
libkpgp - Relicense request denied (and therefore cannot be moved)
