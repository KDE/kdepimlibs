/** @mainpage kpimutils

This library contains utility functions for dealing with email addresses.
This includes parsing, splitting, and munging email addresses represented
as strings (e.g. in email headers); some additional functions handle
non-latin1 upper- and lower-case conversions.

Everything lives in the KPIMUtils namespace.
