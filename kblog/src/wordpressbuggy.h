/**
  @brief
  A class that can be used for access to blogs (Wordpress, Drupal <5.6
  and most likely many more) which simply use the yyyyMMddThh:mm:ss
  dateTime.iso8601 format stated on http://www.xmlrpc.com. This is only an example for
  an ISO-8601 compatible format, but many blogs seem to assume exactly this format.
  This class is needed because KXmlRpc::Client only has support for the extended
  format yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss which is also standard conform and makes more sense than
  the mixture above. This class reimplements createPost and modifyPost from scratch
  to send the dateTime in a compatible format (yyyyMMddThh:mm:ss).

  The rest of the code is inherited from MovableType, as it does not use the dateTime
  format.
  The name is because this problem was first discovered with Wordpress.

  @code
  Blog* myblog = new WordpressBuggy("http://example.com/xmlrpc/gateway.php");
  myblog->setUsername( "some_user_id" );
  myblog->setPassword( "YoURFunnyPAsSwoRD" );
  myblog->setBlogId( "1" ); // can be caught by listBlogs()
  KBlog::BlogPost *post = new BlogPost();
  post->setTitle( "This is the title." );
  post->setContent( "Here is some the content..." );
  myblog->createPost( post );
