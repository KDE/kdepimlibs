Qt4-port
========

* Talk to TT about finding a way to reuse the unget buffer
  It is currently wholly ignored.

* Make KDatagramSocket respect text-mode conventions
  (or not?)

* Use QIODevice's aboutToClose

* All classes must have bytesAvailable and bytesToWrite

* Rename emitsReadyRead & family

* On KStreamSocket::connectionEvent, use indeces instead of iterators
  (KResolverResults is a QList)

* For multicast, use an Interface class
  A better idea would be to replace the Capabilities with C++ interfaces
