 *
 * AnnotationModel is a model-like interface that can be implemented
 * to provide annotation information for each line in a document. It provides
 * means to retrieve several kinds of data for a given line in the document.
 *
 * \section annomodel_impl Implementing a AnnotationModel
 *
 * The public interface of this class is loosely based on the QAbstractItemModel
 * interfaces. It only has a single method to override which is the \ref data()
 * method to provide the actual data for a line and role combination.
 *
 * \since 4.1
 * \see KTextEditor::AnnotationInterface, KTextEditor::AnnotationViewInterface

/**
 * \brief A Document extension interface for handling Annotation%s
 *
 * \ingroup kte_group_doc_extensions
 *
 * \section annoiface_intro Introduction
 *
 * The AnnotationInterface is designed to provide line annotation information
 * for a document. This interface provides means to associate a document with a
 * annotation model, which provides some annotation information for each line
 * in the document.
 *
 * Setting a model for a Document makes the model data available for all views.
 * If you only want to provide annotations in exactly one view, you can use
 * the AnnotationViewInterface directly. See the AnnotationViewInterface for
 * further details. To summarize, the two use cases are
 * - (1) show annotations in all views. This means you set an AnnotationModel
 *       with this interface, and then call setAnnotationBorderVisible() for
 *       each view.
 * - (2) show annotations only in one view. This means to \e not use this
 *       interface. Instead, use the AnnotationViewInterface, which inherits
 *       this interface. This means you set a model for the specific View.
 *
 * If you set a model to the Document \e and the View, the View's model has
 * higher priority.
 *
 * \section annoiface_access Accessing the AnnotationInterface
 *
 * The AnnotationInterface is an extension interface for a Document, i.e. the
 * Document inherits the interface \e provided that the
 * used KTextEditor library implements the interface. Use qobject_cast to
 * access the interface:
 * \code
 * // document is of type KTextEditor::Document*
 * KTextEditor::AnnotationInterface *iface =
 *     qobject_cast<KTextEditor::AnnotationInterface*>( document );
 *
 * if( iface ) {
 *     // the implementation supports the interface
 *     // do stuff
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section annoiface_usage Using the AnnotationInterface
 *
 * \since 4.1
 * \see KTextEditor::AnnotationModel, KTextEditor::AnnotationViewInterface
