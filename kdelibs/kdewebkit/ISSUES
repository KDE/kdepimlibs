Known Issues [PENDING]:
===========================
* [kdewebkit] Handling unsupported content always requires more than one
  connection to the same server to download a single request. The fix for
  this requires an upstream patch that allows us to determine the content
  types by the rendering engine, i.e. webkit.
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37880

* [QtWebKit] HTML 5 <video> tag will not work properly until Qt 4.7 for most users
  depending on how their distro created their Qt library package. As a result of
  differences between the Phonon library needed by KDE and bundled with Qt, most
  distros opt for disabling Phonon support (-no-phonon) when compiling Qt and simply
  use the Phonon libraries from kdesupport to ensure multimedia in KDE is funational.
  Unfortunately, compiling Qt without phonon support means no HTML 5 <video> support
  in the QtWebKit module. This is going to change in the upcoming Qt 4.7 release. For
  details, see https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34631.

* [QtWebKit] Missing Java applet support. See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33044.

* [QtWebKit] No access to the input/control widgets making it very difficult to
  implement very useful features such as:
    ** Form completion like the one available when using native Qt widgets such as
       QLineEdit and QComboBox. See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36668
    ** Spell checking!!

Known Issues [FIXED]:
=========================
* [QtWebKit] Crash while browsing facebook. [QtWebKit 2.0/Qt 4.7]
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35204.

* [QtWebKit] Does not have support "Content-Disposition". [QtWebKit 2.0/Qt 4.7]
  Specifically when it contains the keyword "attachement" the content returned
  is not supposed to be rendered. Test case site: http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36395.

* [QtWebKit] No way to stop <meta> tag based page refresh. [QtWebKit 2.0/Qt 4.7]
  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29899
