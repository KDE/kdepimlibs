README for kjsembed qtonly
--------------------------

This document explains how to install a current development copy of the Qt only
version of kjs/kjsembed from subversion sources.

First, make sure you have a copy of Qt 4.2.0 or greater installed on your 
machine, configured as you need it.  Make sure your QTDIR environment variable
points at this location.  Then set the other environment variables like so:
$ export QJSDIR=<your_install_prefix_here>
$ export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$QJSDIR/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$QJSDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

where <your_prefix_here> is the location you want the Qt only version of the 
kjs and kjsembed libraries installed.

Choose one of these lines depending on how you access SVN:

REPOSITORY=svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde
REPOSITORY=svn+ssh://username@svn.kde.org/home/kde
REPOSITORY=https://username@svn.kde.org/home/kde

where username is your KDE Subversion username.

$ svn co $REPOSITORY/trunk/KDE/kdelibs
$ cd kdelibs/kjsembed/qtonly
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$QJSDIR ..
$ make
$ make install

The resulting build will create the following hierarchy under your $QJSDIR:
lib/
	libqkjs.so - The Qt Only version of the kjs library
	libqkjsembed.so  - The Qt Only version of the kjsembed library
bin/
	js - The Qt Only version of the js command included with the kjs library.
	qjscmd - The Qt Only version of kjscmd.

include/
	kxmlcore - kxmlcore headers
	kjs      - kjs headers
	kjsembed - kjsembed headers
