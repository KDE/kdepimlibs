This file is intended as entry point for the win32 port of KDELIBS.

Any developer interested into working on the win32 port is invited 
to start at http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KDE_on_Windows for an overview 
and status of the port. 

BUGS: 

- replace the absolute pathes in KDE4LibsDependencies.cmake generated by export_library_dependencies 
  by variables computed on configure time of package using KDE4LibsDependencies.cmake
  (from CMakeLists.txt 
    # !!! the following stuff does not work because export_library_dependencies
    # !!! does not wait until the file is written completly 
    #        export_library_dependencies(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/tmpdeps.cmake)
    #        file(READ ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/tmpdeps.cmake _deps)
    #        string(REPLACE "${QT_INSTALL_DIR}" "\${QT_INSTALL_DIR}" __deps "${_deps}")
    #        file (APPEND ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/KDELibsDependencies.cmake "${__deps}")




TODO:
- add description and version number to shared libraries. 

- add application icons to executables  -> the cmake macro KDE4_ADD_WIN32_APP_ICON (see KDE4Macros)
  is intented to allow this
