Changes to xsl/fo/*

  | 2004-12-02  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* table.xsl: Added missing col parameter to
  | 	  table.cell.properties template.
  | 
  | 2004-11-27  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* table.xsl: Inherited cell properties now passed to
  | 	  table.cell.properties template so they can be overridden by
  | 	  a customization.
  | 
  | 2004-11-26  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* table.xsl: Added support for bgcolor PI on table row
  | 	  element.
  | 
  | 2004-11-24  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* titlepage.xsl: Fixed handling of abstract title.
  | 
  | 2004-11-23  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* autotoc.xsl: RFE #1069397 Add new parameter
  | 	  simplesect.in.toc - default value of 0 causes simplesect to
  | 	  be omitted from TOCs - to cause simplesect to be included in
  | 	  TOCs, you must set the value of simplesect.in.toc to 1 note
  | 	  from Norm: Simplesect elements aren't supposed to appear in
  | 	  the ToC at all. Ugh. The Definitive Guide doesn't really
  | 	  explain that very well. The use case for simplesect is when,
  | 	  for example, every chapter in a book ends with "Exercises"
  | 	  or "For More Information" sections and you don't want those
  | 	  to appear in the ToC.
  | 
  | 	* param.ent, param.xweb: RFE #1069397 Add new parameter
  | 	  simplesect.in.toc - default value of 0 causes simplesect to
  | 	  be omitted from TOCs - to cause simplesect to be included in
  | 	  TOCs, you must set the value of simplesect.in.toc to 1 note
  | 	  from Norm: Simplesect elements aren't supposed to appear in
  | 	  the ToC at all. Ugh. The Definitive Guide doesn't really
  | 	  explain that very well. The use case for simplesect is when,
  | 	  for example, every chapter in a book ends with "Exercises"
  | 	  or "For More Information" sections and you don't want those
  | 	  to appear in the ToC.
  | 
  | 2004-11-21  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* sections.xsl: It is not possible to use variable reference
  | 	  in template match. I change it back and preserved intended
  | 	  semantics. But there might be more elegant way to do it, I
  | 	  did't have time to investigate it, I just wanted to process
  | 	  my document :-(
  | 
  | 2004-11-20  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* lists.xsl: bug #1007414 & patch #971730 - passivetex outputs
  | 	  "* 0.60 + 1em" garbage in lists (reported by Alex Roitman
  | 	  and James William Pye) ::PROBLEM Literal stuff "* 0.60 +
  | 	  1em" showing up in listitem PDF output generated through
  | 	  passivetex ::CAUSE Logic that outputs non-constant size
  | 	  expressions like "4em * 0.60 + 1em" was added to stylesheets
  | 	  to improve look of list formatting. But passivetex can only
  | 	  handle constant sizes; so, instead of doing the math, it
  | 	  spits out the literal expressions in output. ::FIX Added
  | 	  workaround - some conditional logic to fall back to constant
  | 	  values if passivetex.extensions param is non-zero.
  | 	  ::AFFECTED AREAS Should only affect FO output when
  | 	  passivetex.extensions is non-zero
  | 
  | 2004-11-18  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* component.xsl: Moved the literal attributes from
  | 	  component.title to the component.title.properties
  | 	  attribute-set so they can be customized.
  | 
  | 2004-11-17  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* pi.xsl: Fix bug in dbfo-need for XEP output.
  | 
  | 2004-11-16  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* lists.xsl: Added glossdef's first para to special handling
  | 	  in fo:list-item-body.
  | 
  | 2004-11-11  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* sections.xsl: Fixed /section template to work with rootid
  | 	  parameter.
  | 

Changes to xsl/html/*

  | 2004-11-23  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* autotoc.xsl, param.ent, param.xweb: RFE #1069397 Add new
  | 	  parameter simplesect.in.toc - default value of 0 causes
  | 	  simplesect to be omitted from TOCs - to cause simplesect to
  | 	  be included in TOCs, you must set the value of
  | 	  simplesect.in.toc to 1 note from Norm: Simplesect elements
  | 	  aren't supposed to appear in the ToC at all. Ugh. The
  | 	  Definitive Guide doesn't really explain that very well. The
  | 	  use case for simplesect is when, for example, every chapter
  | 	  in a book ends with "Exercises" or "For More Information"
  | 	  sections and you don't want those to appear in the ToC.
  | 
  | 	* refentry.xsl: Patch #1057029 - Fix titleabbrev warnings in
  | 	  reference (patch from anatoly techtonik)
  | 
  | 	* sections.xsl: Bug #1068455 (Invalid h7, h8, etc. generated
  | 	  for deeply nested sections) ::CAUSE Stylesheet HTML
  | 	  heading-generation didn't anticipate that some jokers like
  | 	  to nest sections really, really deep. Not naming any
  | 	  names... ::FIX Refined logic to safely handle documents
  | 	  produced by the "I can nest sections deeper than you can"
  | 	  crowd
  | 
  | 2004-11-19  Michael Smith <xmldoc@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* sections.xsl: Bug #1066753 -- subtitle is severely broken
  | 	  (reported by Sam Steingold) ::PROBLEM In (X)HTML output,
  | 	  subtitle for the simplesect element generates an h2 head, no
  | 	  matter at what level in the sectioning hiearchy the
  | 	  simplesect occurs; end up with cases where a simplesect is
  | 	  output with (for example), an h4 title but a h2 subtitle
  | 	  ::CAUSE and FIX No template for simplesect/subtitle in the
  | 	  set of templates that call the section.subtitle named
  | 	  template, so stylesheets fell back to using the
  | 	  titlepage.mode template for subtitle ::FIX Added
  | 	  simplesect/subtitle to the set of templates that call the
  | 	  section.subtitle named template. ::AFFECTS Only affects
  | 	  (X)HTML output of simplesect/subtitle; nothing else
  | 
  | 2004-11-17  Jirka Kosek <kosek@users.sourceforge.net>
  | 
  | 	* Makefile.param, autoidx.xsl, docbook.xsl, param.ent,
  | 	  param.xweb: Added new parameter index.prefer.titleabbrev.
  | 	  When set to 1, index references will use titleabbrev instead
  | 	  of title when available.
  | 
  | 	* manifest.xsl: Removed reference to index HTML pages from
  | 	  manifest if the output format is HTML Help
  | 
  | 2004-11-13  Robert Stayton <bobstayton@users.sourceforge.net>
