/**
  This class provides a resource which is managed in a general way.

  A Resource represents the concept of an object with the following attributes:

  - Applications operate on sets of one or more Resource objects.
  - Creation and deletetion of Resource objects is done in a general way,
    independent of concrete functionality of the Resource.
  - The end user has control over creation, deletion and configuration of
    Resource object.
  - Properties, behaviour and configuration of different Resource objects can
    widely differ.
  - Resources can be active or inactive.
  - There is one special Resource which is the standard Resource. This can for
    example be used as default destination for newly created object managed
    by a certain Resource family.
  - Activation of Resources can be covered by a two step process of being opened
    and then loaded. Deactivation corresponds to saving and closing.
  - Different application ususally share the same set of Resources.

  The Resource base class provides the management functionality. Classes
  inheriting from Resource automatically appear in the general kresources
  kcontrol module.

  Concrete functionality of Resources is specified per family by a subclass of
  Resource. This classes in turn have subclasses which implement the different
  flavors of the functionality represented by the family.

  A subclass should reimplement at least the constructor and the
  writeConfig method.

  An example for a Resource subclass hierarchy would be the "calendar" family.
  The ResourceCalendar subclass would specify an API for accessing calendar
  data. Subclasses of ResourceCalendar would implement this API for local files,
  remote files, specific calendar servers etc.
